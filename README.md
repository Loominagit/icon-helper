# The main idea
You may be wondering: *"why this bot exist?"*, *"why do you think it's useful omegalul"*. Well, to answer the question, I need to tell you a story. While I am new designing in Figma, I find copy and pasting icons between drafts really annoying. Thus I lost motivation on designing UI because of it. I think I found a solution. I had a thought that I can find icons through Discord, and copy the icon from it without having a hassle switching between drafts. I spent a day to implement this bot, and here it is.

# Features
- Easy-to-use bot
- It has autocomplete
- You can find different variant from 1 icon

# Supported Icon Packs
This bot currently only supports [Fluent Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons), at least for now.

# To-do
- [ ] Better caching
- [ ] Better embedding
- [ ] Add [Material Icons](https://github.com/google/material-desgin-icons)
- [ ] Optimize the code
